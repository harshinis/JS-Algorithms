Create a function called tripleAdd that is invoked like this

and returns the total of all 3 numbers that are passed.
How to invoke three functions 3 times ?

We are not invoking function 3 times, we are invoking what is being returned to us and again invoking it 3rd time 
of what ever is returned after 2nd time


Solution:
tripleAdd function is called curried function;
Currying of a function is the technique of translating one function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of 
functions that each take a single argument.
